# Python Practice Set

This repository contains 50 small Python programs, organized as one folder per exercise. Folder names follow `PS##_<description>` (for example, `PS01_sum_diff_product`).

## Running an exercise
- Change into a folder and run its script, e.g.:
  - `cd PS01_sum_diff_product`
  - `python3 main.py`

## Notes
- Each `main.py` is interactive where input is required.
- Folder names are zero-padded to keep ordering clear.***
